# NPC &amp; faction downtime

NPC 們and factions also do things when the PC 們have downtime. The GM **advances their project clocks** and chooses a downtime maneuver or two for each faction that they’re interested in at the moment. Choose any maneuver that makes sense for that faction to pursue. For example:

* Seize a claim or increase hold, make an enemy vulnerable, or reduce the hold of a vulnerable enemy.
* Gather information on the PC 們(may be opposed by a PC roll) or another subject.
* Achieve a short-term goal they’re in position to accomplish.
* Acquire a new asset.
* Call in a favor from another faction.
* Employ political pressure or threats to force someone’s hand.

**GM:** Choose downtime maneuvers and advance clocks for the factions you’re interested in right now. Don’t worry about the rest. Later, when you turn your attention to a faction you’ve ignored for a while, go ahead and give them several downtime phases and project clock ticks to “catch up” to current events.

If you’re not sure how far to progress a faction’s clock, make a fortune roll using their 層級 as the base trait, modified up or down depending on the opposition or circumstances. Tick 1 segment for a 1-3 result, 2 segments for a 4/5 result, 3 segments for a 6 result, or 5 segments for a <span class="game-term">關鍵</span> result.

When factions do things that are known in the criminal underworld, **tell the players about it** through one of their **friends** or **contacts** or **惡習 purveyors**. These rumors and bits of gossip can lead to future scores and opportunities for the PCs.
