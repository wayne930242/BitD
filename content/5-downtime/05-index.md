# Stress Relief

Your characters are a special lot. They defy the powers-that-be and dare to prey on those who are considered to be their betters. They push themselves further than ordinary people are willing to go. But this comes at a cost. Their life is one of constant stress. Inevitably, each turns to the seduction of a **惡習** in order to cope.

A character’s 惡習 is their obsession. But with this indulgence comes relief from stress and the ability to once again face the overwhelming challenge of their daring life.

# Indulging Your 惡習

When you indulge your 惡習, you clear some stress from your character’s stress track. Say how your character indulges their 惡習, including which **purveyor of 惡習** they use to satisfy their needs.  This indulgence takes time, so it can only be done when the crew has **downtime**. Alternately, you may choose to release your character to be “lost in their 惡習” during a game session, allowing them to indulge off-camera while you play a different PC. A gang member, friend, or contact of the crew might be created as an alternate character to play, thus fleshing out the landscape of PCs.

You roll to find out how much stress relief your character receives. A 惡習 roll is like a resistance roll in reverse—rather than gaining stress levels, you clear stress levels. The effectiveness of your indulgence depends upon your character’s worst attribute rating. It’s their weakest quality (<span class="game-term">洞察</span>, <span class="game-term">匿蹤</span>, or <span class="game-term">決心</span>) that is most in thrall to 惡習.

Make an **attribute roll** using your character’s lowest attribute rating (if there’s a tie, that’s fine—simply use that rating). **Clear stress equal to the highest die result.**

## Overindulgence

If your 惡習 roll clears more stress levels than you had marked, you overindulge. A 惡習 is not a reliable, controllable habit. It’s a risk—and one that can drive your character to act against their own best interests.

When you overindulge, you make a bad call because of your 惡習—in acquiring it or while under its influence. To bring the effect of this bad decision into the game, select an overindulgence from the list:

* <span class="game-term">Attract Trouble.</span> Select or roll an additional **entanglement**.
* <span class="game-term">Brag</span> about your exploits. **+2** <span class="game-term">追緝</span>.
* <span class="game-term">Lost.</span> Your character vanishes for a few weeks. Play a different character until this one returns from their bender. When your character returns, they’ve also healed any harm they had.
* <span class="game-term">Tapped.</span> Your current purveyor cuts you off. Find a new source for your 惡習.

## Ignoring your 惡習

If you do not or cannot indulge your 惡習 during a downtime phase, you take stress equal to your <span class="game-term">創傷</span>. If you don’t have any <span class="game-term">創傷</span>, you’re free to ignore your 惡習. It doesn’t have a hold over you (yet).

## Roleplaying &amp; XP

Along with your character’s heritage and background, their 惡習 tells us what kind of person they are. This obsession impacts their motivations, goals, and behavior. When you ponder what your character might do or say next, you can always consider their 惡習 to help you think of something. As an added benefit, by playing to the nature of your character’s 惡習, you earn xp at the end of the session.
