# A Guide To Using the Blades in the Dark SRD with Creative Commons

This is aimed at designers, writers, and publishers who’d like to build on the Creative Commons release of the Blades in the Dark System Reference Document. From here on in, we’ll just call it “the SRD”.

The most important thing to understand if you’re new to Creative Commons licenses is that we’ve chosen the most liberal one possible. In particular, the license we chose isn’t viral, which means you don’t have to license those works under a Creative Commons license if you don’t want to!
